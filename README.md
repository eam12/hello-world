# hello-world
My first repository!
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm trying to learn!

This GitHub tutorial was very useful: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Now I'm making changes to the master branch. I know I am not supposed to do this, but hey, I'm learning by doing.

Now I'm trying to link a pull request to a fake issue I created.
